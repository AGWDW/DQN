# DQN
Deep Q Neural net

An ai that learns to solve the cart pole problem in Open Ai Gym (lib)
contins my implementation - VERY slow
a tutorials's - uses GPU pytorch (will require a cuda enabled GPU)
and a Q table (For frozen lake)

requires open ai gym, pytorch (should get all other libs requires)

1st attempt
